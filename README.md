- Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  - The purpose of the DriverPass project was to create a website that helps train students for their driving test. The client was DriverPass and they wanted me to design a system that would allow students to take online classes and practice tests. They also wanted the system to allow students to make a reservation online to schedule on-the-road training with one of their drivers. 
  
- What did you do particularly well?
  - I think what I did particularly well was outline the objectives and goals of the system. I gave a fairly detailed description of what the system should by including elements of the system and what should be a part of each element. 
  
- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  - If I could choose one part of my work on these documents to revise, I would pick the use case diagram for the DriverPass project. I would improve it by providing more detail on how the different actors interact with the system and adding more specific use cases.
  
- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  - I interpreted the user's needs by reviewing their requirements and making sure that the system would meet their needs in terms of functionality, security, and usability. It's important to consider the user's needs when designing a system because the success of the system depends on whether it meets the needs of the users.
  
- How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
